# Mahalanobis distance

## Notebook 01

After displaying a simple (bivariate) example on the calculation of Mahalanobis distances, the notebook illustrates their efficiency for identifying outliers, first using a classical covariance determination (from numpy), then using a robust covariance estimate (from scikit-learn). Finally, the combined use of the scikit-learn EllipticEnvelope and DecisionBoundaryDisplay, which achieves similar results on a (very) simple daataset, is shown for illustration purposes.
